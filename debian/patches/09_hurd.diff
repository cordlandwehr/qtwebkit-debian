Description: quick fix for compilation on Debian/Hurd
 Patch 06_kfreebsd_strnstr.diff uses __GLIBC__, so make sure to have this
 definition (provided by any C stdlib header) at this time. Include stdlib.h
 on Hurd only, as it seems to be working already on the other archs.
 A better fix (adding WTF_OS_HURD and using it where needed) should be done
 upstream.
